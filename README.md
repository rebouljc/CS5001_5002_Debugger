**Project Desription**  
Smashin' Debugger is a project to create a debugger designed to be lightweight, portable, and easy to use for both experienced and inexperienced developers. 
The goal of the architecture design it to be easy to port/implement new programming languages, instruction sets, debug-data formats, and operating systems.  

**Project Abstract**  
Many popular debuggers don’t have a graphical interface, are built into an
Integrated Development Environment, or only work well on one operating
system or one programming language. Smashin’ Debugger is a standalone,
lightweight, portable, yet powerful debugger that comes with a user interface
designed to look and feel the same no matter the operating system. Smashin’
Debugger’s framework is designed so that future contributors can port the
Smashin’ Debugger to other operating systems, implement new programming
languages, or design new user interfaces with ease.
