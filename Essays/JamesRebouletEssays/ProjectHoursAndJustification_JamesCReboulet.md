### Total Project Hours for Both Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 Semesters: 84 hours.

### Justification:

I did not, per se, actually keep track of all of the hours that I had spent in creating the source-code viewer, so the total number of hours could have actually been greater than 84, since I am going from my estimation, based on the details that I can remember from both semesters.  I had spent the first semester primarily working on the documents design, as required for the course; and I did not actually write any program code or complete the other tasks until the start of the second semester, so most of my time on this project was spent during the second semester.
